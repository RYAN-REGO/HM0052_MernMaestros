# HM0052 MernMaestros

## Develop a streamlined platform for addressing the lack of personalized mentorship using efficient mentor matching, and ensuring tailored and effective mentorship experiences. 

## Description
Our project aims to address the pressing issue of the lack of personalized mentorship by developing a streamlined platform that leverages efficient mentor matching algorithms. Through this platform, users will be matched with the most relevant mentors based on their interests, goals, and background. Additionally, the platform will facilitate one-on-one video calls between users and mentors to ensure tailored and effective mentorship experiences.

## Features
- Users can join as mentors or mentees.
- Users can create and edit their profiles.
- Mentees receive mentor recommendations based on profile inputs.
- Mentees can book one-on-one video and chat sessions with mentors from the mentor search page.
- Mentors can see session requests and accept or decline them from their dashboard.
- Accepted sessions lead to live video calls and chat interactions in the "Join a Meet" section.
- suggestions based matching of mentor and mantees through aiml model integration
- voice to text conversion using NLP for effective communication

## Tech Stack
